# What Is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks. As I learn more about this field, I’m beginning to understand how important it is in everyday life—from protecting personal information to securing entire organizations.

## Why Cybersecurity Matters
Cybersecurity matters because the world relies heavily on technology. Every time I use my phone, log in to an account, or make an online purchase, I’m interacting with systems that could be targeted by hackers. Learning cybersecurity helps me understand how to stay safe and how to prevent these attacks.

## Key Areas of Cybersecurity
As a beginner, I’m focusing on understanding these core areas:

### 1. **Confidentiality**
Keeping information private. Only the right people should access the data.

### 2. **Integrity**
Ensuring information is accurate and hasn’t been changed without permission.

### 3. **Availability**
Making sure systems and data are accessible when needed.

These three principles are known as the **CIA Triad**, and they form the foundation of cybersecurity.

## Cybersecurity Examples I’m Learning About
- Protecting passwords and user accounts  
- Understanding malware like viruses, worms, and ransomware  
- Learning how firewalls and antivirus tools work  
- Recognizing phishing attacks and social engineering  
- Exploring how networks and data are secured  

## Why I’m Learning Cybersecurity
I want to build a strong foundation in protecting data and understanding how digital systems work. Starting with the basics helps me grow step-by-step into more advanced topics like penetration testing, network security, and threat analysis.
